**Sam's DayZ Object Finder** is work in progress tool by SamGeekMan to help DayZ modders, map makers, and server owners find the objects they need. 

Designed to be used with Terrain Builder, DayZ Editor and other modding tools, once complete it will have **every object in the game**, searchable by common names, size, colour, type and more - all with image previews. 

No more having to remember obscure object names, and the ability to browse by category, and search for items like 'large snow rocks'. 

> ⚠️ This tool is very much still a work in progress! Functionality will change, and many more objects still need to be added. See progress in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414751374394261534).

**How to use**

Browse by category and search for specifics. 

Many items feature search tags and allow you to combine them to create useful searches like

> `green backpack`


> `large snow rock`


> `small yellow birch`


> `akm mag`

You can also filter for console compatible objects.

**Errors and suggestions**

There will be errors in spelling and taxonomy - all this was done by hand! Report errors in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414754388064604220).

**A tool made by SamGeekMan to help DayZ modders and server owners find the objects they need - without having to remember obscure object names...** 

Designed to be used with Terrain Builder, [DayZ Editor](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2250764298) and other modding tools.

> ⚠️ This tool is very much still a work in progress! Functionality will change, and many more objects still need to be added. See progress in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414751374394261534).

**How to use**

Browse by category and search for specifics. 

Many items feature search tags and allow you to combine them to create useful searches like

> `green backpack`


> `large snow rock`


> `small yellow birch`


> ‘akm mag'

You can also filter for console compatible objects.

**Errors and suggestions**

There will be errors in spelling and taxonomy - all this was done by hand! Report errors in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414754388064604220).

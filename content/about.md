## About

**Sam's DayZ Object Finder** has been designed to be used with DayZ Editor,  Terrain Builder and other modding tools.

**Once complete**, it will have everything object in the game search by hand-added tags - all with image previews.

No more having to remember obscure object names, and the ability to browse by category, and search for items like 'large snow rocks'. 

Developed by SamGeekMan.

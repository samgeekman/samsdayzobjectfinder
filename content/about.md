## How to use

> ⚠️ This tool is a work in progress. Every object has been added, images and tags currently being added. See progress in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414751374394261534).

- Press 🏗️ to copy the object to DayZ Editor - just switch to the Editor and press Ctrl + V to paste on your cursor
- Press 📋 to copy the object name to your clipboard

Almost every object in the game has been tagged by hand, meaning you  search by common name, size, colour, type and much, much more. 

> `green backpack`


> `large snow rock`


> `small yellow birch`


> `akm mag`

You can also browse / filter by category, and filter for console compatible objects.

## About

**Sam's DayZ Object Finder** has been designed to be used with DayZ Editor,  Terrain Builder and other modding tools.

**Once complete**, it will have everything object in the game search by hand-added tags - all with image previews.

No more having to remember obscure object names, and the ability to browse by category, and search for items like 'large snow rocks'. 

Developed by Samgeekman.

Much appreciation to [Bauvdel](https://bauv.dev/) for developing a massively timesaving screenshot tool to make my life easier. 

**Errors and suggestions**

There will be errors in spelling and taxonomy - all this was done by hand. Report errors in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414754388064604220).
